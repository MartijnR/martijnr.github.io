### Improvements

This is a snapshot of the main improvements to Enketo in the past 6 months:

* Added basic [Range widget](http://xlsform.org/en/#range). 
* Added Ranking widget.
* Added URL widget.
* Added [`randomize()` function](https://docs.opendatakit.org/form-operators-functions/#randomize). This function is exposed [via a shortcut in XLSForm]((http://xlsform.org/en/#randomize-choices)) for easy use.
* Added [`decimal-time()` function](https://docs.opendatakit.org/form-operators-functions/#decimal-time).
* Added [`distance()` function](https://docs.opendatakit.org/form-operators-functions/#distance) was added.
* Performance of autocomplete widget with huge external data files (XML or CSV) has improved enormously in Chrome and Firefox (15,000 items is not a problem on most devices!).
* The expression `". < today()"` should now work as expected across time zones (a 5 year old bug).
* The required asterisks (*) now update in real-time if an expression is used.
* All draw widgets now have a download function (like the file upload widgets).
* Drawing and annotate widgets now have an _undo_ functionality.s
* File upload widgets no support "new", "new-front", "new-rear" on some cutting-edge mobile browser.
* Reset functionality for draw and file upload widgets now requires confirmation.
* New line and paragraph handling in labels and hints has improved.
* Many styling and accessibility improvements.
* API endpoints for PDF-creation of empty forms and records were added. 
* Loading performance has been improved. 
* Russian and Polish translations were added.
