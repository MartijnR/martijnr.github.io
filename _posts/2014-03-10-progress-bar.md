Enketo now has a subtle progress bar fixed to the top of the screen. 

![Progress Bar](../files/2014/03/progress-bar.png "Progress Bar")

The bar indicates the current position in the form. This means when you reach question number 30 out of 100 enabled questions, it will show as 30% full. 

This feature was developed by Ona and Enketo LLC for the [HRP](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/mhealth/en/) project under a contract with [WHO](http://who.int).
