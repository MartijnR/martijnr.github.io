I’m excited to announce that the enketo source code has now been released under an open source license on [GitHub][1] and that enketo has received a great boost!

I’ve joined the [formhub][3] team at Modilabs (Columbia University) and will continue working on enketo for them in the next few months. This means enketo (or enketo-powered tools) will become a reality and will benefit greatly from lots of new ideas of, and collaboration with, the very talented Modilabs team. In the past 2 weeks the new direction and look has started to take shape and it is going to be very cool. The active repository for enketo in the near future will be [this fork][4]. The best source for news on enketo will probably become the [formhub blog][5].
