The [new geo widgets](/geo) have been extended to show multiple map layers. You can now switch between streets, terrain and satellite maps. See [this sample form](https://geo.enketo.org/webform).

### How to use

The layer switcher will appear automatically on all geo widgets in Enketo. 

If you'd like to show a particular layer as the _default layer_ when the form loads, simply add the name of the map layer to the appearance columnn in your XLSForm.
