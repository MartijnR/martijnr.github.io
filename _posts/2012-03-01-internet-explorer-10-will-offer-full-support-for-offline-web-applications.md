Some good news, that I had missed until now: The new version of Internet Explorer (IE 10) will likely finally support a [key feature][1] for launching web applications offline! Naturally this only works if the application was designed to do this. Read more about offline capable web applications[ this previous post][2].

Unfortunately, Internet Explorer 10 will only run on Windows 7 and Windows 8, so for the foreseeable future that will still exclude most of the field workers in developing countries from using offline-capable web applications unless they upgrade to a [non-Microsoft browser][4]. Still, IE10′s support is a decent step forward for the ‘offline web’!

\[Edit: when testing [Enketo][5], the offline launch does not appear to work correctly yet in the current preview version of IE10\]
