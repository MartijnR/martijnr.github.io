After completing the final two major "required" features, i.e. __form authentication__ and __calculations inside repeats__, a new phase has arrived for enketo. Many new features are still planned but these fall mostly in the "nice to have" category and are less of a priority. The new phase will first focus more on _stabilizing_, _improving_, and _fixing_ existing features.

Fixing bugs will always remain a priority. The other planned work will take place behind the scenes and should make it easier to maintain and to contribute to the enketo source code. Enketo will become more robust, faster and better in all aspects. The pace of this work will depend on the requirement of the sponsor(s) but it is expected to continue steadily.

Work on [enketo.org](https://enketo.org) will get a high priority in July. If your organisation would already like to start using enketo.org, to help test the service, please let me know. I would be happy to manually add support for your Aggregate or Formhub server for the period until launch.

More about the plans for [enketo.org](enketo.org) soon!
