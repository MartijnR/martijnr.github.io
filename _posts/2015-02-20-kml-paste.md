Another update to the Geo Widgets! You can now cut and paste a KML <Polygon\> to record a geoshape, e.g. if the polygon was collected using a dedicated GPS device. This feature was introduced in December 2014 and is available in all Enketo tools with an up-to-date version of [Enketo Core](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-core). 

### How to Use

The following screenshots show how this feature can be used. Try it yourself by clicking on one of them to open a demo form.
