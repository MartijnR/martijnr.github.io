After a 10 month break due to a consultancy for UNHCR (and a partial basement renovation), work on Aid Web Solutions projects is now slowly re-starting again!

I moved the [site][1] and this blog from Concrete5 to WordPress and used a fresh design. This time I went for a commercial off-the-shelf theme (and hacked it) to save time. WordPress is impressive so far and seems suitable for non-blog sites as well. I still like the simplicity of [Concrete5][2], but it had some limitations for my requirements. Moreover, I enjoyed the opportunity to learn how to work with a (for me) new CMS.
