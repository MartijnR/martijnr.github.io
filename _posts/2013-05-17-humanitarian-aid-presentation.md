I had the opportunity to remotely present Enketo Smart Paper during the [Humanitarian Nomad](http://humanitarian-nomad.org/) workshop in Paris yesterday. A pretty cool milestone because enketo was developed specifically for humanitarian aid workers and is now robust enough to be widely deployed in the field. See the slides below.

I plan to do a lot more promotion for Enketo Smart Paper in the future and hope I can be present in person at the next [Humanitarian Nomad](http://humanitarian-nomad.org) event. Thanks to [iMMAP](http://www.immap.org/) and [CartONG](http://cartong.org/) for leading this initiative and helping organisations find the right tool for the job with their [online selection tool](http://humanitarian-nomad.org/online-selection-tool/).
