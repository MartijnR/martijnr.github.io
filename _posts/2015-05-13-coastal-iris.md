Enketo is being used by Noam Rozenfeld to conduct ecological surveys of open spaces on a reserve in Israel.

Noam became familiar with Enketo at his job with the Survey of Israel, a government-run national mapping office. Enketo was used with formhub to perform quality checks on information contractors put in databases. Compared to ARC Collector, Enketo was simpler to use and information could be easily seen on the fly. 

As a volunteer, Noam goes to the reserve near his home and catalogs the various plant and animal life.<img src="../files/2015/05/irus1.jpg" title="coastal iris" alt="coastal iris" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;"/> A unique feature of the reserve is the presence of the coastal iris (Iris atropurpurea), a critically endangered plant only present in Israel. The reserve contains the largest population in the world, and it is being monitored using Enketo. The survey Noam developed using Enketo also allows him to report problems or maintenance that needs to be done. Invasive plant species have been identified so they can be eradicated. For the first time in four years, Noam discovered the return of the mountain gazelle to the reserve. The data that is collected by Noam and other volunteers is used to help educate the public through signposts and information pages. Ultimately, Noam would like to be able to use the information collected to create a Crowdmap and utilize the information as a tourist guide.
