### Enketo has joined ODK!

I started Enketo in 2009 as a web-based alternative to [ODK Collect](https://docs.getodk.org/collect-intro), the popular Android app for offline data collection. Over time, Enketo has grown into a core component of great products like [Ona](https://ona.io), [KoboToolbox](https://ona.io), [OpenClinica](https://openclinica.com), [Survey123](https://survey123.arcgis.com), and of course, [ODK](https://getodk.org).

Though I have had a great time developing Enketo and collaborating with so many impressive people, the past few years I have become more and more interested in working on other things (such as woodworking). In August 2021, the ODK team agreed to take on further leadership of the Enketo project. 

One and a half year later, it is clear that Enketo is in excellent hands. ODK (especially [Yaw Anokwa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanokwa), [Hélène Martin](https://forum.getodk.org/u/ln/summary), and [Trevor Schmidt](https://github.com/eyelidlessness)) have been doing an awesome job adding performance improvements, aligning behavior with ODK Collect, fixing critical vulnerabilities, and many other things. I am very impressed with their thoughtful approach to development (and am learning from it) and their willingness and ability to make big investments in improving the code, toolchain and maintainability. I am so happy that Enketo is continuing to thrive.

Many thanks to ODK and all of Enketo's contributors over the years!
