The National Democratic Institute (NDI) has been using Enketo to help monitor elections across the world.  In late 2014, Enketo was used with formhub to monitor the Tunisian presidential and parliamentary elections.  Most recently, Enketo was used during the historic elections in Nigeria for president, house, and the senate.  

While NDI uses formhub for many of their data collection needs, Enketo proved to be a good solution that allowed for the simplification of front end data cleanup and collection processes.  Enketo has been useful in allowing NDI to manage its forms from the web interface, and ultimately has made NDI’s programs more efficient and scalable.  

For the first time in their history, NDI has been able to collect International Election Observer Mission (OM/EOM) data in near real time using Enketo with formhub and the GeoODK application.  During an International Observer Mission, qualified experts from across the globe are selected to monitor specific polling stations across a country.  They must then report their findings to a data or command center which is usually located in the capital.  Prior to using Enketo, these reports were either written reports or verbal reports to the data center that then had to be transcribed by clerks.  Although this produced much useful information, it was not in a useful format for the Mission’s post-election statement which has to be delivered within hours to a few days of the close of the polls.  Enketo enables observers to analyze data more quickly and view it on a broader scale, resulting in more comprehensive post-election statements.
